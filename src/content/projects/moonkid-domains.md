-- Moon - crypto slang used to describe the continuous upward movement of a cryptocurrencyâ€™s price.
## Introduction

**Moonkid Domains** is a fully decentralised domain name similar to .eth but with no governing/centralized oversight. One major flaw of listing this domain name for sale on platforms like Porkbun and Encirca is that they are a governing body upholding US Laws. Thus, defeating the purpose of decentralisation. Whoops.


### Background

In 2021 I was getting somewhat involved in Crypto and especially the project [Read about Handshake Domains](https://handshake.org/). I bought the domain Moonkid along with Moons and after reaching out to several Registrars both were listed on [Buy Moonkid on Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/tld/moonkid) and [Buy Moons on EnCirca](https://www.encirca.com/handshake-moons/). 

## What does this mean?

Welp, I guess nothing really. Other than it was fairly simple to get my domains listed on a Registrar available to the public to pay with cash. I only ended up making a few thousand bucks. That said, it's been a lifelong goal of mine to launch a Top Level Domain and this was a fun learning experience. 

While not quite a true TLD (the application alone is around 200K) this was probably the most fun I've had. 

## Outcomes

I met a lot of people, made a few sales, and learned a lot about the potential of the space. 

### Product Hunt

Got to the 3rd Product of the day on Product Hunt. Back in 2022, this was actually a fairly big deal. Around 10K people viewed the site that day.

## Conclusion

Next time, I'll pick a better name. I wasn't able to get moons until a few months after Moonkid.
